# Quotes about Programming and Software

## Fixing the World

> Programming is a science dressed up as art, because most of us don’t
> understand the physics of software and it's rarely, if ever, taught. The
> physics of software is not algorithms, data structures, languages, and
> abstractions. These are just tools we make, use, and throw away. The real
> physics of software is the physics of people. -- [P. Hintjens, ZeroMQ: Messaging for Many Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/zeromq/9781449334437/)

> Specifically, it’s about our limitations when it comes to complexity and our
> desire to work together to solve large problems in pieces. This is the
> science of programming: make building blocks that people can understand and
> use easily, and people will work together to solve the very largest problems.
