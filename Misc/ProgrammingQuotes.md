# Quotes about Programming, Software and related things

## Fixing the World

> Programming is a science dressed up as art, because most of us don’t
> understand the physics of software and it's rarely, if ever, taught. The
> physics of software is not algorithms, data structures, languages, and
> abstractions. These are just tools we make, use, and throw away. The real
> physics of software is the physics of people. -- [P. Hintjens, ZeroMQ: Messaging for Many Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/zeromq/9781449334437/)

> Specifically, it’s about our limitations when it comes to complexity and our
> desire to work together to solve large problems in pieces. This is the
> science of programming: make building blocks that people can understand and
> use easily, and people will work together to solve the very largest problems.

## From Chapter 2 "Origins of Information Theory"

> [...] we can learn at least two things from the history of science. One of
> these is that many of th e most general and powerful discoveries of
science have arisen, not through the sudy of phenomena as they occur in nature,
but, thater, through the sutdy of phenomena in man made devices, in products of
technology, if you will. This is because the phenomena in man's machines are
simplified and ordered in comparison with those occuring naturally, and it is
these simplified phenomena that man understands most easily.
