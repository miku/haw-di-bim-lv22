### Dataset on the Internet

The internet is home to many valuable datasets and more structured data is
put out every year. The spectrum ranges from offical data published by
governmental institutions to independent collection efforts of individuals and
small teams. Here, we highlight a sample of these data sources.

Most popular sites are aggregators, run by institutions, companies or communities.

* [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/), hosts larger
  open data sets, such as satellite imagery or web crawling data. In Spring
  2020 147 datasets are hosted. Data from these sources is frequently
  referenced in research.
* The [European Data Portal](https://www.europeandataportal.eu/) aggregates
  data from over 80 data sources and provides ready-to-download data in various
  categories, like economy and finance, transport or environment. Currently
  over a million files are available. Examples are: list of charging stations
  in a region, number of teachers by school type or a financial institution
  risk exposure report.
* The US [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset) initiative currently
  contains 210878 datasets, many from geoscience and NOAA, but also economic or
  census data.
* In early 2020, Google started [Google Dataset
  Search](https://research.google/tools/datasets/), providing search across [25
  million](https://www.blog.google/products/search/discovering-millions-datasets-web/)
  datasets, across various topics, such as agriculture, engineering, life
  sciences or humanties. In addition, it highlights many training set for
  machine learning tasks such as Oxford Flowers, Fashion MNIST, Stanford Cars
  Dataset, and many more.
* Community efforts like
  [awesome-data](https://github.com/datasets/awesome-data) group data by topics
  and link to many other grouping sites like the [UCI machine
  learning](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) dataset list (over 400
  datasets for data analysis and machine learning).
* Archives and memorial institutions like the [Internet
  Archive](https:/archive.org) and [New York Public
  Library](https://www.nypl.org) have own collections, like
  [Datasets](https://archive.org/details/datasets), [bibliographic data](https://archive.org/details/ia_biblio_metadata) or NYC history [Spacetime](http://spacetime.nypl.org/) project.
* Other initiative collect data source manually, such as the [data is
  plural](), which hosts a publicly accessible
  [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit)
  of data annotated datasets.
* Research data sets are becoming a more relevant part of the scientific
  process and sites and projects emerged which host these datasets, such as
  [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [DataCite](https://datacite.org/),
  [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) and many more. Among hosting, many services
  also provide the provision of custom document object identifiers (or DOI for
  short). These DOI help to make data citable.

Many other organisation publish their own data, and we want to highlight a few:

* A great source of econometric data (mostly time series) is the Economic
  Research facility of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,
  [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) for short. Theirs over 700000 time
  series capture a comprehensive image of economic activity past and present.
  The data is of excellent quality and their website is quite accessible.
* The German Weather Service (DWD) publishes climate data for Germany, Europe
  and the World, with dozens of measurements taken from thousands of stations
  around the globe. They honor a classic file transfer protocol and provide FTP
  access on:
  [ftp://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC](ftp://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC).
* The Kaggle project hosts many datasets at
  [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). At the
  time of writing, there are 37474 published datasets, high quality datasets
  provided by institutions and individuals alike. From COVID-19 research over
  Brazilian housing marked to wine reviews, you'll find an inspiring mix of
  data ready to be analyzed with Pandas.
* Another high quality list of datasets can be found at
  [https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets).

These sources alone probably encompass more than 30M datasets, in CSV, Excel or
other formats. While access and availability have become much better in recent
years, one needs to keep in mind the future accessibility of this data as well.
If your analysis should be reproducibly, you will need a backup or preservation
