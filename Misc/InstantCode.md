# Instant Coding Sites

It has been getting easier to just run some code on some machine without much
else than a web browser. Examples include:

* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), and Jupyter Lab, which includes Notebooks, Scripts, a Terminal and more
* Online IDEs like [repl.it](https://repl.it),
  [Skulpt](https://skulpt.org/gallery.html),
  [playcode](https://playcode.io/javascript),
  [vscode.dev/](https://vscode.dev/), [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com/),
  [gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/), [codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/) and
  [more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_integrated_development_environment)

## Pros

* just type code, no need to install anything
* a compact set of tools, integrated
* you do not need to learn how to set things up

## Cons

* you do not learn, how certain things are setup
* probably constrained access to files, data, ...;  your data may escape your control
* may need internet connection

In general, any additional layer add a bit of complexity and nomenclature that
may be confusing (even though the interface seem simpler). When you have access
to a terminal and run `python myscript.py` what is happening may be more obvious
(albeit even there, a lot of things happen).



## Snippets

Snippets from the web:

> With developer tools moving to the cloud, the creation and adoption of cloud
> IDE (Integrated Development Environment) platforms is growing. Cloud IDEs
> allow for real-time collaboration between developer teams to work in a unified
> development environment that minimizes incompatibilities and enhances
> productivity. Accessible through web browsers, cloud IDEs are available from
> every type of modern device. Another advantage of a cloud IDE is the
> possibility to leverage the power of a cluster, which can greatly exceed the
> processing power of a single development computer. -- [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-the-code-server-cloud-ide-platform-on-digitalocean-kubernetes](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-the-code-server-cloud-ide-platform-on-digitalocean-kubernetes)
