A primer on RDF: [https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-rdf11-primer-20140624/](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-rdf11-primer-20140624/)

> The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a framework for expressing
> information about resources. Resources can be anything, including documents,
> people, physical objects, and abstract concepts.

> RDF is intended for situations in which information on the Web needs to be
> processed by applications, rather than being only displayed to people. RDF
> provides a common framework for expressing this information so it can be
> exchanged between applications without loss of meaning.
