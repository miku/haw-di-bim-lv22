# Unsorted

Unsorted ideas and notes.

## Interaction

It would be interesting to go from drawing, scribbling to a website. The "no-code" idea.

Generate a random website design.

* semantic markup, e.g.
  [time](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time),
[mark](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/mark) and
[more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics)
* [accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/), [WCAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines)

## Topics

* SVG, MathML
* maps; leaflet
* canvas
* [WebAssembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly)
* collaborative filtering;

## Possible tasks

* one task during course can be the formulation of a pull requests on a shared
  repository; e.g. heycloud website; need 30 or 60 things to fix or features
* given a dataset, identify at least one "issue"
* given a website, write a short proposal to enhance HTML, overall appearance, accessibility
* test a website with a bandwidth rate limiting
* analyze the requests of a website of your choice; what requests are made; what's the purpose
* formulate a wikidata query; [https://query.wikidata.org/](https://query.wikidata.org/)

Find a unusual, but interesting dataset. -- let other's vote on the
"interestingness", e.g. by giving a mark 0 (boring), 1, 2, 3 (cool).

## Method and Tools

* use etherpad
* use polls; poll site
* use shared coding pad for python, js, etc.
* look into existing options: codepen, replit
* breakout with task; maybe 5-6 people
* visualize git execution

## Server

* lv22.info/user, e.g. lv22.info/~martin
* quiz.lv22.info/q/bfq9cd
* poll.lv22.info/p/haiw1y
* code.lv22.info
