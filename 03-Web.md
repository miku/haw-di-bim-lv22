# Web and Tools

The web is a network, of people and machines. The protocols enable, among many other things:

* to browse the web (as a human)
* to browse the web (as a machine, crawler, or scraper)
* to offer services (to other machines)
* to combine services to build products for humans and machines

## Protocols

* [RFC Index](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc-index.html)
* e.g. [HTTP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616), [HTTP/2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc87409, [RDF mime type](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc3870), ...

Different protocols typically use different (server) ports, which are specified
by [IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml) (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)

Beside RFC, the many web related specifications are also available by [W3C](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/):

* [https://www.w3.org/TR/]()

Examples:

* [Data on the Web Best Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-dwbp-20170131/)
* [Best Practices for Publishing Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-ld-bp-20140109/)
* [SPARQL Overview](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-overview-20130321/)
...
* [XML in HTML Meeting Report](https://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-xh-19980511) (1998)

## Internet

* OSI protocol model with mostly TCP/IP 
* [Layer Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model#Layer_architecture)

* servers, clients, routers, firewalls, proxies, etc.

## Web Sites

* user-generated content
* recommendation systems

## Web Services

* machine oriented
* different styles, e.g. Representational State Transfer (REST)
* web apis - web application programming interfaces
* example public web apis: [https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
