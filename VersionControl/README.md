# Version Control

Any technique and tool to keep track of changes to a project over time.
Essential for software development. Usable for small and large projects alike.
Collaboration tool.

Many [version control
systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version-control_software)
exists; we'll focus on a popular choice these days:
[git](https://git-scm.com/).

> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to
> handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and
> efficiency.

> Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast
> performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and
> ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas,
> and multiple workflows.

# Git

## Basics

The `git` program is a command line too manage changes over time. It is fully
distributed. There are about eight commands you need to know to get started:

* git init
* git status
* git add
* git commit
* git log

And, if you work with a second location (apart from your local directory):

* git remote
* git push
* git pull


## Git Hosting

A popular approach is to work *locally* and share your work on the *web*, with the help of sites like:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)
* [SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/)

and more: [GitHosting](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitHosting)

This allows to share and follow work and facilitates collaboration.
