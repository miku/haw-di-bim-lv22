# Server

We can use a web server for the duration of the course. You can login, serve
files, setup a cms or run simple applications.

## Request Account

* [Account Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFWi4vV0d7CuqDP5sP2y2rdNQSLfAPlT-6sGgHCYSdmmT3Nw/viewform)

The username needs to be unique (you will get an email if it is not).

## Account Request Form Text

> With an email, username and a public key you can request SSH access to the
exacloud.cc playground server.

> If your username has not been taken already, your SSH account should be available a few minutes after you submit this form. If your username has been taken already, you may receive an email notice.

> You will be able to log in to the server, e.g. with the following command:

    $ ssh username@exacloud.cc

If you do not have an SSH public key yet, you can generate one on your machine. Here are some docs:
