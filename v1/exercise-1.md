# Exercise 1

Prepare a 2 minute lightning talk on a command line tool of your choice.

* research a command line tool of your choice; here are some lists for
  inspiration: [List of Unix
commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unix_commands),
[awesome-cli-apps](https://github.com/agarrharr/awesome-cli-apps), [https://www.wezm.net/technical/2019/10/useful-command-line-tools/](https://www.wezm.net/technical/2019/10/useful-command-line-tools/), ...
* maybe you already have a favorite tool, then tell us about it!
* explain the tool briefly, as you would explain it to a colleague; functionality, when to use, example
* 120s only!
* use slides or do some live example with screen sharing

> Essentially, it allows you to do stuff faster then GUI AND provides an amazing **automation** support built in.

A longer take:

A key skill.
