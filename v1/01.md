## Motivation

Programming is a generic technical skill, independent of any particular language or platform.

### Reasons to learn programming

* Programming helps you **understand computers**. The computer is only a tool. If
  you learn how to write simple programs, you will gain more knowledge about
  how a computer works.
* Writing a few simple programs increases your confidence level. Many people
  find great personal satisfaction in creating a set of instructions that **solve
  a problem**.
* Learning programming lets you find out quickly whether you like programming
  and whether you have the analytical turn of mind programmers need. Even if
  you decide that programming is not for you, understanding the process certainly
  will increase your appreciation of what programmers and computers can do.

### Definitions

Mirriam-Webster defines programming:

> the planning, scheduling, or performing of a program

First known use 1896.

Other:

> Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation
> (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by
> designing/building an executable computer program. Programming involves tasks
> such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and
> resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a
> chosen programming language, commonly referred to as coding).

Computers compute, but:

> Computers were invented to *compute*: to solve *complex mathema-
tical problems,* as the dictionary still defines that word. They still do
that, but that is not why we are living in an *Information Age.* That
reflects other things that computers do: **store and retrieve data**, **manage
networks of communications**, **process text**, **generate and manipulate
images and sounds**, **fly air and space craft**, and so on.
