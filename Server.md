# Server

We can use a web server for the duration of the course. You can login, serve
files, setup a cms or run simple applications.

> [https://www.exacloud.cc/](https://www.exacloud.cc/)

## Tools

* [Cloud HAW](https://cloud.haw-hamburg.de/)
* [Etherpad](https://etherpad.exacloud.cc/) (s.a. [Datensparsame Tools für die Lehre](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/detail/news/news/show/datensparsame-tools-fuer-die-lehre/))
* [HedgeDoc](https://docs.exacloud.cc/)
* SSH access to [exacloud.cc](https://www.exacloud.cc/)
* user directories - like [exacloud.cc/~martin](https://www.exacloud.cc/~martin)

The hardware for [exacloud.cc](https://www.exacloud.cc/) is a dedicated machine
for this course; current location: Falkenstein/Vogtland. 

## Request Account

* [Account Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFWi4vV0d7CuqDP5sP2y2rdNQSLfAPlT-6sGgHCYSdmmT3Nw/viewform)

The username needs to be unique (you will get an email if it is not).

## Account Request Form Text

> With an email, username and a public key you can request SSH access to the
exacloud.cc playground server.

> If your username has not been taken already, your SSH account should be
> available in at most 24h. If your username has been taken already, you may
> receive an email notice.

> You will be able to log in to the server, e.g. with the following command:

    $ ssh username@exacloud.cc

If you do not have an SSH public key yet, you can generate one on your machine. Here are some docs:
